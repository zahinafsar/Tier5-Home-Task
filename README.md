# Tier5 Home Task

![Stack](https://github.com/zahinafsar/Tier5-Home-Task/blob/main/public/video.gif?raw=true)

The app is built to display user activities and data graphs. I have used MERN stack technology to develop the app. The app is highly performant almost for 10milion+ user data. I have followed all the conventions and best practices to design the data model and backend API. The API can fetch dashboard data in less than 1 second. I have used typescript to prevent frontend bugs and make the app more scalable.
